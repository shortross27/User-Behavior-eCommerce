# Project Title: Analyzing User Behavior in eCommerce

## Introduction
This project utilizes the User-Behavior eCommerce dataset sourced from Kaggle, which captures user interactions on an online retail platform. The dataset includes various attributes, such as user IDs, product categories, timestamps, and actions taken, providing insights into customer purchasing behavior. This analysis aims to uncover patterns in user engagement and product performance, ultimately helping to inform strategies for improving sales and user experience.

## Objectives
- Identify trends in user purchases over time.
- Analyze the most popular product categories.
- Explore the relationship between user behavior and sales performance.

## Tools and Techniques
For this project, I employed:

- Excel for an initial overview and validation of the data.
- Python (using libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib) for exploratory data analysis, creating bar plots, scatter plots, and generating insights.
- Tableau for developing an interactive dashboard to visualize trends and findings effectively.

## Data Overview
The dataset comprises:

User interactions including views, purchases, etc.
Attributes like user ID, product ID, category, price, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Bar Plot: Visualized purchase frequency by product category.
Scatter Plot: Showed the relationship between product price and purchase rate.

## Key Findings
Highlight any interesting trends such as popular categories, user engagement patterns, or correlations found.
